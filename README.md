# Detailed Guide on using the Autobrewer by BossFlea
## Guide made by catumn (Lephiz69)

## Stage 0: Getting started
### **üìù Notes (important):**
 - This guide is based on the [small autobrewer](https://github.com/BossFlea/autobrewer/blob/main/mainbrewer/autobrewer_small.litematic), Other builds should be basically the same steps.
 - Make sure that your build is correct block for block. You may face errors in litematica such as [wrong redstone](https://i.ibb.co/N6yKdCZk/image.png) near the water bottles chests and [blocks placement error](https://i.ibb.co/BHQkVVKm/image.png) near the brew chests.

	  - For the first error, it is fixed in later steps.
	  - For the latter, you can safely ignore it because it's just the way you oriented the farm and does not impact anything

Now, let's get into the gritty details of operating the machine.

## Stage 1: Awkward Potion making

- **Step 1:** Put any item in the highlighted dropper A.
*It can be anything, such as a snow minion, or a cake. Just make sure it isn't a special item such as an enchanted diamond*

-   **Step 2:** Put items which are stackable to 64 in the highlighted hopper B.
_It can be a stack of rotten flesh. Again, make sure it isn't a special item such as enchanted rotten flesh._

-   **Step 3:** As shown in the image, fill chest A with nether wart and fill chest B with golden carrots.,

*You will need to wait a little **before starting** as the stacks of warts slowly fill into brewing stands one by one. Once all the materials have been transferred, the seepage of it will stop.*

-   **Step 4:** Fill Chests A with empty bottles. This is merely for your convenience,
Stand at B and fill the bottles letting it go into your stash. 
/pickupstash and start filling the chests 
The lamps are an indicator if bottles are in the chest. Fill all 12 chests.

Now, you are ready to proceed with the final step of this stage.

### **IMPORTANT: Open all the brewing stands before proceeding. You have to do this every time you start a brewing session. If your island is unloaded, it will reset.**

Note: Island unloads in ~10 seconds if you don't joins back in
You can use an ALT or a COOP to bypass that, but be aware that sometimes the game may take their alchemy level for brewing. It is best to have the island empty during this.

-   **Step 5:** Flick lever A.

This will start the brewing. Bottles will automatically load into the chest, get brewed, and then sent to their respective chests above the materials area. This process will repeat until you stop it, or bottles run out. The redstone lamp at the end of the hopper line will turn on if everything is full. You may stop the brewer by flicking the same lever again. 
**Make sure you don't leave the island while this happens, it can result in confusing issues.**

-   **Important:** In the leftmost brewing stand, you will see there is no nether wart. This is because the netherwart is actually in the stand behind this one. The one you are looking at was the stand which produces night vision potions. It is such because Invisible potion is the only potions which requires two brews to make. Hence we do it earlier. They are collected in the chest in front. **This will be used in stage 2.**,

-   **Optional step:** verify the contents of the chests to ensure it is all awkward potions and no water bottles have secretly mixed in.

## Stage 2: Material Madness,

This is where we will finally craft the potions. Get ready for immense loss of your purse.

-   **Step 1:** Start filling in ingredients in the brewing stand.

Follow the item frame above or the signs infront correspondingly. 

- **Info:** This is a bit obvious, but you get 3 potions for each item you put in. So divide by 3 your number of planned splashes to get the ingredient number.

-   **Note that:**
    -   Magic Find Potion, Spirit Potion, Wisp's Ice Flavoured Splash Potion and all the skill exp potions are to be filled in the chests above the brewing stand.
    -   Enchanted cakes aren't stackable, so they are also to be put in the chest above. They will need to be taken from chest and manually put into brewing stand each splash brewing,
    -   You'll have to take the night potions from the earlier chest (the one we used in golden carrots), to the chest of Fermented Spider Eye.
    -

-   **Step 2:** Now, we fill in the redstone, glowstone and gunpowder stands.
   
    **Note: white carpet = light gray carpet in the schematic, I have used white carpet to avoid confusion.**

-   Redstone stands: You have to put in either none, enchanted redstone block, or enchanted redstone lamp depending on the carpet infront (on the same Y- Level)
	-   Red Carpet: Enchanted Redstone Block
	-   Orange Carpet: Enchanted Redstone Lamp
	-   White Carpet: None

-   Glowstone stands: Put in either Enchanted Glowstone (block) or none.
    -   Yellow Carpet: Enchanted Glowstone (block)
    -   White Carpet: None

-   Gunpowder stands: Put in either Enchanted Gunpowder or None
    -   Gray Carpet: Enchanted Gunpowder
    -   White Carpet: None

**Step 3:** Fill in these chests with respective brews for convenience.

**IMPORTANT: Make sure to open every brewing stand before continuing!!**

-   **Step 4:** Finally, it is time for brewing!!!

- First, turn on **Enable Input**. 
This will allow the placement of brews. It is recommended to just keep this on forever. 

- Now, be careful. Just flick the lever "Move Potions" **ONCE**. 
This will move the potions down and they will start automatically brewing. 
	- **For the potions which require brews**, fill in the respective brews from the rightmost side. 
	The required brew is shown in an item frame above the brewing stand.

- Once the rightmost side brewing is **finished**, **flick the lever again.**
- This will cause it to go down to redstone stands.
	- only follow this pattern if you start placing the brews from the **rightmost side**

- Once again, if the rightmost brewing stand brewing is done, flick the lever again.
	- This will cause it to go down to glowstone stands.
- Once the glowstone stands brewing is done, flick the lever again.
	- This will cause it to go down to gunpowder stands.
- Once the gunpowder brewing is done, flick the lever again.
	- This will finally store it to the storage area below. This brew is completed.

Repeat this process to get all the splashes.
